NDSummary.OnToolTipsLoaded("CClass:VectorExt4",{78:"<div class=\"NDToolTip TStruct LC\"><div class=\"TTSummary\">Defines a variation of Vector4 that also supports swizzling. The reason this isn\'t part of Vector4 is that construction of all properties is far too heavy to place on the main class. This is only useful in non-critical path (in terms of speed) code. The usage generally looks like: Vector4 newv = ((Vector4Ext)v).zyx;</div></div>"});
