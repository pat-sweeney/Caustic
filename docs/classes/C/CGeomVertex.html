 <div class="CBody"><p>Defines a vertex in our mesh.</p><p>TODO: This used to be part of the Mesh library, but I have since moved it into the renderer. The problem is that I want to be able to share building of vertex buffers between the renderer and the mesh object without having to copy a lot of data around. Thus I need this type in this layer. This needs to be rethought about how to handle properly.</p><p>Defines a vertex on our mesh. We have two types of vertex data: 1) data that is specific to a vertex relative to a given face 2) data that is relative to a vertex regardless of face The reason for this split is so that positional information can be shared across the mesh (useful for performing operations on the geometry) while data that can change from face to face is stored separately (such as normal information).&nbsp; Typically most mesh data is stored in CGeomVertex. Only faces at material boundaries or smoothing groups contain CFaceVertex data.</p><div class="CHeading">Header</div><p><a href='../../index.html#File:Rendering/Caustic/RenderTypes.h' target='_top'>#include &quot;Rendering/Caustic/RenderTypes.h&quot;</a></p></div>
