This folder contains the configuration files and output from NaturalDocs.
There are 3 configuration files:
      Comments.txt
      Languages.txt
      Project.txt
These were created by running the command line (from our $CausticRoot folder)
	"C:\Program Files (x86)\Natural Docs\NaturalDocs.exe" docs
We then hand edited the generated Project.txt file.

For more details see the NaturalDocs documentation at:
	https://www.naturaldocs.org/whats_new_in_2.0/configuring_and_running/

NOTE: Only this README and the 3 files listed above are checked into github. The generated documentation is not checked in.
