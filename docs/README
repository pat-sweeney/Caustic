This folder contains the configuration files and output from NaturalDocs.
There are 3 configuration files:
      Comments.txt
      Languages.txt
      Project.txt
These were created by running the command line (from our $CausticRoot folder)
    "$(CausticRoot)\External\NaturalDocs\CLI\bin\Release\NaturalDocs.exe" docs
We then hand edited the generated Project.txt file.

In order to build Interop\Renderer you must have WPFDXInterop installed:
https://github.com/Microsoft/WPFDXInterop
This should be cloned under $(CausticRoot)\External

To install NaturalDocs you need to enlist in the git repository:
    https://github.com/NaturalDocs/NaturalDocs
This should be cloned under $(CausticRoot)\External

For more details see the NaturalDocs documentation at:

NOTE: Only this README and the 3 files listed above are checked into github. The generated documentation is not checked in.
