# Caustic
Caustic is my personal library that I use for building various graphics applications. 
This is a code base that I have worked on and off for the past several 
years. I am currently porting it from my internal git repository to this 
repository and in the process cleaning up a bunch of the code. 
The code is currently licensed under the MIT License. See file LICENSE for details.

## Building
In order to build the solution you need to edit Caustic.props and modify \<CausticRoot> to point to the folder that contains the source.

## Documentation
Documentation for the library can be found at https://pat-sweeney.github.io/Caustic/
